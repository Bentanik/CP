Step 1: Understand the problem and sample test cases

The problem give 2 values input: N (number friends) and M (number left shoes)
Output is find minimum number of extra shoes
So, We can found that N * 2 = the total number of shoes the chef need to buy
Now we have total shoes (N * 2), take total shoes minus number left shoes equal right left shoes

Step 2: Generate examples - Create 10 input and output cases of your own
Input:
6
1 4
2 4
3 4
4 4
5 4
6 4
Output: 
1
2
3
4
6
8


Step 3: Observations / Pattern - Observe your examples to identify the logic

Left Shoe: *
Right Shoe: /;

Test case 1: (N < M)
Input: 1 4
1*2 = 2 (The number of shoes)
4 (The left shoes)
Because have 4 shoes, so we only add 1 right shoes to total shoes(left shoes + right shoes) = the number of shoes = 2
/ / / /
*/ */
=>The minimum extra shoes = 2/2 = the number of shoes/2

Test caes 4: (N = M)
Input: 4 4
4*2 = 8 (The number of shoes)
4 (The left shoes)
Because have 8 shoes, so we add 4 right shoes to total shoes(left shoes + right shoes) = the number of shoes = 8
/ / / / / / / /
*/ */ */ */ */ */ */ */
=>The minimum extra shoes = 8/2 = the number of shoes/2

=>With case(N<=M) => The minimum extra shoes = the number of shoes/2 = N*2/2 = N

Test case 5,6 (N > M)
Input: 5 4
5*2 = 10 (The number of shoes)
4 = (The left shoes)
Because have 4 shoes, so we add 5 right shoes + 1 left shoes to total shoes = the number of shoes
=>The minimum extra shoes = The number of shoes - the left shoes = 10-4 = 6
Input: 6 4 
Output: 6*2-4 = 8

Step 4: Plan your code - Modularise and solve sub-components of your problem
Build a program run each test case
if(N<=M) cout<<N;
else cout<<2*N-M;
cout<<"\n";

Step 5: Learn - You may come across components of you logic where you don't know how to execute the code.
In such cases, ask Google or ChatGPT or your friends and learn!
Step 6: Write the code - For simpler programming problems - C++ solutions will be less than 20 lines in more than 95% of the cases.
Input number test case
Build program in step 4 by loop

int n; cin>>n;
while(n--){
 program step 4:
}
