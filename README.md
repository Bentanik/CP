How to solve programming problems: </br>
Step 1: Understand the problem statement and the sample test cases </br>
Step 2: Generate examples - Create 10 input and output cases of your own </br>
Step 3: Observations / Pattern - Observe your examples to identify the logic </br>
Step 4: Plan your code - Modularise and solve sub-components of your problem </br>
Step 5: Learn - You may come across components of you logic where you don't know how to execute the code. </br>
In such cases, ask Google or ChatGPT or your friends and learn! </br>
Step 6: Write the code - For simpler programming problems - C++ solutions will be less than 20 lines in more than 95% of the cases. </br>
Step 7: Identify edge cases - If your code still fails - try and and come up with corner cases where your code may fail </br>

Note: Don't spend more than 30 minutes on any problem. While the objective is to learn - if you don't know the approach, it's best to learn the concept / review the solution. </br>
